# Image-Caption-Generation

## 1. Dataset
There are around 8000 images and captions corresponding to the images. Each image have multiple captions.

## 2. How to go about this problem?
We have images and captions corresponding to the images but we don't know how to make use of it to generate captions for new incoming images.

We need a model which might take a image and with some computation magic it provide us the caption.

If you know a bit about deep learning models, it take images in the form of pixels and return output depending on the use-cases. Here, we need both images and texts as input for the model which will provide output with its ML magic.

## 3. How the machine will understand features of the image and the text xorresponding to the features?
